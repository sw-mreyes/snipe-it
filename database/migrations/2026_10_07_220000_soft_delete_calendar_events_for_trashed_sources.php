 * One-shot cleanup for installs that ran either of the earlier
 * calendar backfill migrations before the trashed-source gate landed.
 * Those backfills loaded sources withTrashed() and force-synced them,
 * which published live calendar_events rows for records the admin had
 * already soft-deleted. The user-visible symptom was deleted
 * Maintenances showing up on the calendar with no way to open or
 * remove them (see issue #19760).
 *
 * For every HasCalendarEvents source model, soft-delete the
 * calendar_events rows whose source row is currently trashed. This
 * matches the shape the deleted observer would have written if the
 * source had been soft-deleted after the backfill, so if the admin
 * ever restores the source, the restored observer's query-builder
 * restore brings these back live.
