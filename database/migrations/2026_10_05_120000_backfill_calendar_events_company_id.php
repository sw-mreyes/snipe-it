/**
 * Catch-up migration for installs that already ran the original
 * create_calendar_events_table + backfill migrations before the
 * calendar_events.company_id column existed. Fresh schemas built
 * after the create migration gained the column no-op through this
 * migration via the hasColumn gate, and even when the column exists
 * we only touch rows whose company_id is still null, so an install
 * that already got populated via the updated backfill migration
 * skips the heavy work.
 *
 * Uses single-pass correlated-subquery UPDATEs per source class
 * rather than iterating source rows through the observer. On a
 * 500k-asset install the Eloquent-driven path would have fired
 * half a million UPDATE round-trips. This is three statements
 * total, scoped to NULL rows.
